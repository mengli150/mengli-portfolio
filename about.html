                    <p>Developed SocialCompass, a cloud-native app designed to support Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs) in social communication.</p>
                    <p>At Dell Technologies InnovateFest 2024, my team and I built <strong>SocialCompass</strong>, an innovative solution to help PWIDs develop confidence in social interactions. The app features <strong>Guided Scenarios</strong>, allowing users to practice real-world conversations with instant feedback and rewards. It also includes an <strong>AI-powered Chatbot</strong> for emotional regulation and online communication training, enabling smoother interactions in everyday situations.</p>
                    <p>Leveraging <strong>microservices architecture</strong>, <strong>Harbor</strong>, and <strong>OpenShift</strong>, we ensured seamless updates, scalability, and resilience. Our chatbot utilized <strong>NVIDIA NIM</strong> to experiment with domain-specific AI models, optimizing performance and response accuracy.</p>
                    <p>The experience was incredibly insightful, especially during user testing, where I learned the importance of designing with empathy and inclusivity. Huge thanks to my team, our mentors from Dell Technologies, and industry professionals who guided us along the way. This journey reinforced my passion for using technology to drive meaningful social impact. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
